        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and butter in a skillet 
                over medium-low heat. Stir in shiitake mushroom, 
                shallot, salt, sage, and red pepper flakes. Cook and 
                stir until shallot is translucent, about 5 minutes. 
                Mix in turkey and vermouth; stir until heated through, 
                1 to 2 minutes. Remove the skillet from heat.
            </li>
            <li>Beat eggs with a fork in a bowl until well blended; 
                season with a pinch of salt and white pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 teaspoons olive oil in an omelet pan over 
                medium heat until hot. Pour beaten eggs into the pan. 
                Use a spatula to gently stir eggs just until they 
                begin to set, 1 to 2 minutes; shake the pan to cover 
                the bottom completely with egg. Smooth the top of 
                partially set eggs with the spatula; cook until 
                the bottom is firm and the top is still slightly soft, 
                then turn off heat.</li>
            <li>Spoon turkey mixture into the center of omelet, 
                filling about the middle 1/3 of the omelet; dot with 
                small dollops of cr√®me fraiche. Do not overfill omelet. 
                With the spatula, fold the upper 1/3 of the omelet 
                over filling. Gently tip the skillet and shake 
                omelet towards the edge of the skillet. With the 
                spatula, fold omelet over one more time, forming a 
                loose cigar shape. Gently tip omelet onto a serving 
                plate.</li>
